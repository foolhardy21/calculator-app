## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JS Script
- DOM Elements

### Continued development

I wish to improve this project by adding a functionality of solving multiple calculations using BODMAS and improving the edge cases.


### Useful resources
